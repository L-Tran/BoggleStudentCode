| January 5 |    5-6pm     | My initial idea is to use breathe first search from every node and compare each path/word to the dictionary, however I know this will be very inefficient so I thought of new idea. I thought of using DFS instead so I can go down specific paths and also use a TST to store the words. The TST will insure that the words exist and can tell me when to stop if the prefix is not in the dictionary. This is the best method I have came up with but I am a little stuck on the DFS part and how to incorporate it with my dictionary TST. |

I looked at the slides for the recursive version of DFS. At first, I thought it was pretty easy to implement but as I started coding I ran into a major problem. Although my idea involved checking valid prefixes, I do not actually know how to check for them. My first instinct is to create another function in my TST class.|
