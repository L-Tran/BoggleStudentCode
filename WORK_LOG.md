I thought of using DFS instead so I can go down specific paths and also use a TST to store the words. The TST will insure that the words exist and can tell me when to stop if the prefix is not in the dictionary. This is the best method I have came up with but I am a little stuck on the DFS part and how to incorporate it with my dictionary TST. |

I looked at the slides for the recursive version of DFS. At first, I thought it was pretty easy to implement but as I started coding I ran into a major problem. Although my idea involved checking valid prefixes, I do not actually know how to check for them. My first instinct is to create another function in my TST class. |
| January 7 | 1:50-3:00pm  | I came to class ready to fix problem with how to find valid prefixes. Mr. Blick helped me think it through and pointed my to my TST class where I modified the search function to return null if the prefix was not in the tree and the last node traversed if the prefix was in the tree. This made it easier to create my base cases in my DFS function as each case of these variables determines if there prefix is valid, invalid, or een a word. Mr. Blick also pointed out that I was returning in my DFS function when I confirmed a word. I removed it after realizing that even if a word is confirmed, a longer valid word could be made if additional characters are appended. After all of this, my code only worked for testTricky and testCorrectSmall, so I was a bit confused what was going wrong. After asking Mr. Blick for help and a further look at testEdgeCase, we realized that I was not accounting for duplicates. I solved this easily with a Hashset but I will look for a better solution. |
